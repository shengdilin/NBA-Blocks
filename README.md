# Final-Project

Add all of your code and work here as necessary. 


## Files to Keep in the Main Directory (please keep this naming convention)

* `.gitignore` 
* `LICENSE`
* `README.md`
* `Final Project Report.rmd`
* **`Final-Project-Report.pdf`**
* `Final Project Slides.rmd`
* **`Final-Project-Slides.pdf`**

I will be re-knitting your `.pdf`s to make sure they work (this is part of the grading). 

## Files to Move to `files/` or another folder of your creation

* `references.bib` (or whatever you name this) (you'll need to change the name in the `.rmd`s to be `"files/references.bib"`
* Any paper you reference. In fact, all papers you reference should be in this directory
* The [font you pick for your report](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Serif,Sans+Serif)
* Any data you've imported or temporarily saved (again, change the pointer be `"files/..."`)
* Any pictures, etc, that are necessary to knit your documents
* Any `R` scripts you've written to pre-process data
* Basically anything that isn't in the first section. Let me know if there's something you think _should_ be in the main directory. 


## Files to Delete

* Any old versions of the final report or final slides
* Anything that you didn't actually use in your analysis
